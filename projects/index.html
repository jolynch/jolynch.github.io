<p>Below are some of my projects roughly categorized by area.</p>
<h2 id="distributed-systems">Distributed Systems</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/synapse"><code>synapse</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/airbnb/nerve"><code>nerve</code></a> service mesh aka SmartStack. I help
maintain and have contributed significant features to Airbnb&rsquo;s service mesh,
including improving the scalability of the system by multiple orders of
magnitude (Yelp ran tens of thousands of containers across a global network
with full global service discovery), and extending Synapse to be fully
pluggable and support any proxy.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Yelp/paasta"><code>Paasta</code></a> distributed platform as a service. I
was a somewhat minor contributor to Paasta, mostly working on SmartStack
integrations, but I did help port the whole codebase to Python 3 so that was
interesting&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/jvmquake"><code>jvmquake</code></a> agent for rescuing
distributed databases written in Java from themselves by killing them (while
grabbing a core dump) when they enter JVM death spirals. This is basically an
extension of <a href="https://github.com/airlift/jvmkill"><code>jvmkill</code></a> that also
detects GC spirals of death.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Priam"><code>Priam</code></a> distributed sidecar for Apache
Cassandra. I work on this at Netflix, improving operability of Cassandra.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/pinch"><code>pinch</code></a> toolkit for compressing, hashing
and moving data around as fast as you can around a network. This is just
a docker container with all of my favorite data compression and validation
tools built in (e.g. <code>zstd</code>, <code>lz4</code>, <code>xxhash</code> etc &hellip;) and a local <code>go</code> server
that can do it all via HTTP for you (assuming the commands are installed)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/service-capacity-modeling"><code>service-capacity-modeling</code></a>
library for capacity planning (determining which kind and how much of a
computer to buy) for a particular workload such as Apache Cassandra or
Elasticsearch. Essentially a multi-variate monte carlo simulation with a
least regret optimizer over per workload models.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debugging--performance-analysis">Debugging / Performance Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/performance-analysis"><code>performance-analysis</code></a>
collection of <a href="https://github.com/jupyter"><code>jupyter</code></a> notebooks and various
python scripts I&rsquo;ve used to analyze the performance of various service or
database setups. Perhaps one of the more interesting ones is my notebook for
modeling Cassandra availability with different numbers of
<a href="https://github.com/jolynch/performance-analysis/tree/master/notebooks/cassandra_availability">vnodes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/cqltrace"><code>cqltrace</code></a> dynamic tracer for observing
live CQL traffic in real time. I mostly use this for debugging Cassandra
clients and their performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="educational">Educational</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/python_service_performance"><code>python_service_performance</code></a>
A step by step guide on how to make a <code>python3</code> web service based on
<a href="https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi"><code>uwsgi</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid"><code>pyramid</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent"><code>gevent</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx"><code>nginx</code></a> production ready. This means high
scalability and low latency with a typical microservice setup.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="economics">Economics</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/splitit"><code>splitit</code></a> algorithm and Python web
service for fairly dividing items that are hard to value (e.g. rents in a 5
bedroom apartment). I used this with my roommates to divide rent fairly in
San Francisco.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debate">Debate</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MIT-Tab/mit-tab"><code>MIT-TAB</code></a> APDA parliamentary debate
tabulation software. Basically this is a very complicated constraint
optimization problem that debaters used to do by hand, and now a good
fraction of the American Parliamentary Debate Association&rsquo;s tournaments run
with this software. I was the original author but have since handed
development off to <a href="https://github.com/BenMusch">Ben Muschol</a> who has really
improved the project!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="machine-learning--ai">Machine Learning / AI</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/python-hqsom"><code>python_hqsom</code></a> implementation of
the HQSOM deep learning algorithm. This was a project I worked on for a few
graduate classes at MIT (6.867 and 6.868) that used genetic algorithms and
deep learning and other such buzzwords. Surprisingly it actually worked
pretty well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/food.op"><code>food.op</code></a> recipe recommender based on
gradient boosting classifiers. It was a hackathon project but sorta neat to
have recipes recommended based on previous cooking experiences.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolynch/organon"><code>organon</code></a> symbolic constraint framework
and solver for modeling complex constrained systems that may not have
solutions. The
<a href="https://github.com/jolynch/organon/blob/master/papers/final.pdf">paper</a> is a
decent read if you&rsquo;re interested in what this project can do.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/service-capacity-modeling"><code>service-capacity-modeling</code></a>
library for capacity planning (determining which kind and how much of a
computer to buy) for a particular workload such as Apache Cassandra or
Elasticsearch. Essentially a multi-variate monte carlo simulation with a
least regret optimizer over per workload models.</li>
</ul>
