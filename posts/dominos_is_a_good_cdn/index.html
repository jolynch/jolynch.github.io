<p>Today on the
<a href="https://jolynch.github.io/tags/distsys-as-food/">&ldquo;distributed systems as food service analogy&rdquo;</a>
series we visit low latency pizza delivery and how they relate to Content
Delivery Networks (CDN).</p>
<p>Like with <a href="/posts/jimmy_johns_and_web_services/">Jimmy John&rsquo;s</a>, I often
order Domino&rsquo;s pizza not because it tastes particularly good but because
Domino&rsquo;s is efficient! They are one of the only pizza places I know that offer
a latency service level objective
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective">SLO</a>) of less than
thirty minutes. To achieve this promise, they use a number of common techniques
used by Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to ensure that web content such as
photos, code and even videos get to your browser or device quickly.</p>
<p>In this post we&rsquo;ll see how large online services keep their latencies low to
the user by observing the strategies that Domino&rsquo;s in particular, and pizza
delivery in general, have been using for years.</p>
<h1 id="technique-1-many-points-of-presence">Technique #1: Many Points of Presence</h1>
<p>The primary way that Domino&rsquo;s ensures low latency to your door is by having
a large number of what the tech industry calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence">&ldquo;Points of
Presence&rdquo;</a> a.k.a <code>PoP</code>s. These
<code>PoP</code>s are physically close to the customer, which in the case of Domino&rsquo;s
means a driver can actually reach you within the thirty minute SLO. By placing
stores near users, Domino&rsquo;s is able to reduce the average latency that their
customers experience. It isn&rsquo;t enough, however, to just place pizza stores
physically proximate to homes – they must be near major highways or transport
arteries so the delivery drivers can cover a particular delivery area in under
thirty minutes.</p>
<p>You can understand this intuitively by first looking at how a more traditional
&ldquo;Big Pizza Shop&rdquo; model might work where a large store services many customers:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="/img/dominos_big_pizza.svg" alt="dominos_big_pizza"></p>
</center>
<p>In this visualization a single grid tick represents one minute of time, so
our first customer <code>Alice</code> spends about 2 minutes ordering her pizza, then the
pizza shop spends about 12 minutes lovingly hand tossing the dough and cooking
the pizza, and then the delivery driver must drive close to 20 minutes to get
to their door. In this example the end to end latency works out to ~35 minutes
for <code>Alice</code> and ~30 for <code>Bob</code>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Domino&rsquo;s splits their pizza making endeavors into many
smaller points of presence which are closer to their customers. This model
allows the pizzas to arrive back at the customers in a mere 8-10 minutes,
bringing the delivery ETA to under the 30 minute SLO!</p>
<center>
<p><img src="/img/dominos_small_pizza.svg" alt="dominos_small_pizza"></p>
</center>
<p>As it turns out, this is similar to how large websites like Google, Facebook,
and Netflix guarantee low latency delivery of webpages, images, and very
importantly, video. All of these services rely heavily on many small <code>PoP</code>s that
are physically proximate (likely in the same building) to local internet
service providers (ISPs). These <code>PoP</code>s store large, typically static, content
such as client side code (javascript/css/html), images, and of course videos.
While web services might run their core business logic from a relatively small
number of large datacenters that are likely hundreds of miles (and
milliseconds) away, customers can often be served a large percentage of their
content entirely from a local <code>PoP</code> which is plugged directly into the local
ISPs. This technique shaves orders of magnitude off the latency that customers
experience.</p>
<h1 id="technique-2-pre-compute-all-the-things">Technique #2: Pre-compute All the Things</h1>
<p>To meet the thirty minute SLO Domino&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t just have nearby stores – they
also have to be able to make the pizzas extremely quickly. While I have
never personally worked in a Domino&rsquo;s store, when I have on occasion visited
them it appears to me that they are making heavy use of pre-compute, where
you do work ahead of time so you don&rsquo;t have to do it during the actual user
request.</p>
<p>For example, the dough that they use appears to come pre-formed into the right
size balls for various size pizzas; they are ready to roll and top. The sauce
is similarly pre-made to an order and toppings are also all pre-cut and ready
to go. This way when an order comes in, all the worker has to do is take the
pre-prepared dough and roll it, spread pre-made sauce on it, and sprinkle the
pre-prepared toppings on top. Just like we saw in the <a href="/posts/jimmy_johns_and_web_services/">Jimmy John&rsquo;s</a> post, pre-making ingredients before a request
comes in can drastically reduce the latency.</p>
<p>This leads us to the &ldquo;Domino&rsquo;s Model&rdquo; where we have extremely fast ordering,
fast pizza making, and happy customers!</p>

<p><img src="/img/dominos_pizza_full.svg" alt="dominos_full"></p>
</center>
<p>Is it lovingly hand tossed and finished with freshly cut vegetables and meats?
No, but it is extremely efficient and honestly, I enjoy the end result!</p>
<p>The most apt analogy for this is how tech companies pre-compute their
static assets (code, images, video) in various formats and packages before
they upload them to the CDNs. For instance, Netflix might encode a given movie
in various
<a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/per-title-encode-optimization-7e99442b62a2">bitrates</a>
ahead of time so that the CDN just has to deliver the right one. Another
example is how Facebook pre-computes image thumbnails and uploads all the
various sizes and shapes of a given image asset to their CDN so that, again,
all the CDN has to do is return the right asset. A typical web architecture
that uses CDNs looks somewhat familiar:</p>
<center>
<p><img src="/img/dominos_cdn.svg" alt="dominos_cdn"></p>
</center>
<p>The only request that must be served from the far away website servers is the
initial &ldquo;control plane&rdquo;/&ldquo;business logic&rdquo; request, and then all of the content
itself can be fetched directly from the local <code>PoP</code>. Some CDNs are even
starting to offer the ability to run logic that has historically happened
server side
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-unleashed/">on the edge</a> to
bring down latency even further.</p>
<h1 id="imperfect-analogy">Imperfect Analogy</h1>
<p>The CDN and Domino&rsquo;s analogy isn&rsquo;t perfect though. In particular, Domino&rsquo;s
either doesn&rsquo;t have to or cannot do some of the more interesting techniques
that CDNs and their customers must do to meet latency SLOs.</p>
<p>One such interesting technique that websites can use but that Domino&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t is
where browsers or applications fetch static content from CDNs before it is
actually needed (a.k.a &ldquo;pre-fetch&rdquo;).  Naturally, if Domino&rsquo;s did this it would
lead to many confusing doorbell rings, but I have often wondered how hard it
would be for Domino&rsquo;s to use a predictive model to forecast what toppings will
be most popular in a given town or time of week and optimize their just in time
network accordingly.</p>
<p>Another hard problem that tech companies have to solve that Domino&rsquo;s can skip
is which assets to store in the CDN and which assets to not store in the CDN.
Certainly, there are some CDN use cases which are a total cache (the full
dataset is stored on every <code>PoP</code>), but for really huge caches you have to be
selective about what you put where. The only way Domino&rsquo;s would run into this
is if they started offering orders of magnitude more toppings and configurations,
which for the record I would personally be a fan of.</p>
<h1 id="summary-there-is-no-way-around-latency">Summary: There is No Way Around Latency</h1>
<p>In this post we learned how with some relatively simple techniques, Domino&rsquo;s is
able to deliver pizzas to your door with low latency just like web services are able to
serve up pictures of cats quickly. Both systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilize many hundreds of Points of Presence (<code>PoP</code>s) to drive latency
down.</li>
<li>Optimally place <code>PoP</code>s near major transportation (internet) hubs to
provide low latency.</li>
<li>Pre-compute as much as possible so that the final assembly of the
pizza (request) can be done as fast as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed, any service that wants to minimize latency to users such as Domino&rsquo;s
pizza delivery, package shipping and distribution, or even distributing
videos on the web can benefit from these simple techniques.</p>
