      <title>Supermarkets And Efficient Queueing: Part 2</title>

      <description>This post continues the two part series on queueing theory and understanding computer systems using supermarkets.
 Part 1: Basics of queueing theory and minimizing latency. Part 2: More advanced techniques past optimizing latency.  We learned in Part 1 that we should keep our queues together and if we must form separate queues we should always try to pick the shortest queue if we can. In this post we will see that isn&amp;rsquo;t quite true if you care about metrics other than throughput.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to kickoff the &amp;ldquo;distributed systems as food service analogy&amp;rdquo; series with the basics. In this two part series I cover the basics of queuing theory , and how we can understand it with the help of your every day supermarket or grocery store.
 Part 1: Basics of queueing theory and minimizing latency. Part 2: More advanced techniques past optimizing latency.  Why should software engineers care about Queueing Theory?</description>

      <description>I figured it was time to start a proper personal/tech blog given how much I enjoy writing about the crazy fun and wierd distributed systems problems that I work on.
Initially I am planning on writing up my current rants on high performance software systems as understood through food service analogies, but I imagine it&amp;rsquo;ll evolve from there to just talking about cool systems problems I work on every day.</description>
