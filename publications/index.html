<p>I&rsquo;ve mostly written blog posts and whitepapers, mostly for employers. I&rsquo;ve
included links here in case they might be interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/pdf/cassandra-availability-virtual.pdf">Cassandra Availability with Virtual Nodes</a>
(2018): A whitepaper I authored with Josh Snyder that gt attempted to formally model
Cassandra&rsquo;s availability under different numbers of tokens per node. TLDR:
use no more than 4 tokens if you want high availability in a Dynamo style
database. The paper is based on <a href="https://github.com/jolynch/python_performance_toolkit/blob/master/notebooks/cassandra_availability/cassandra_availability.ipynb">this
notebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2017/05/taking-zero-downtime-load-balancing-even-further.html">Taking Zero Downtime Load Balancing even Further</a> (2017): In this post I showed how Yelp had
evolved their highly available and scalable service mesh based on SmartStack
to use NGINX and HAProxy and get the best of all worlds.</li>
<li><a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/06/monitoring-cassandra-at-scale.html">Monitoring Cassandra at
Scale</a>
(2016): A post I wrote for Yelp about how they monitored their distributed
Cassandra deployments taking into account full ring health. Also includes
some helpful examples for how to interact with Cassandra&rsquo;s JMX interface from
Python.</li>
<li><a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/04/true-zero-downtime-haproxy-reloads.html">True Zero Downtime HAProxy
Reloads</a>
(2015): A post I wrote for Yelp about how they reloaded HAProxy without any
downtime to requests using Linux queueing disciplines. A super hacky way to
achieve the end that has since been superseded by better techniques. It was
pretty cool though.</li>
<li><a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2014/11/scaling-elasticsearch-to-hundreds-of-developers.html">Scaling Elasticsearch to Hundreds of Developers</a>
(2014): A blog post I wrote for Yelp about the Apollo data gateway which
acted as a proxy tier to NoSQL databases such as Elasticsearch (And later
Cassandra). Basically this was an API-gateway for datastores, which was
ridiculously useful and helped Yelp&rsquo;s distsys-data team scale datastores and
upgrade them all the time.</li>
